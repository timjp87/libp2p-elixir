  Minimal libp2p building blocks (spec-driven).

  This library is intentionally small and explicit. Protocols are implemented as
  separate modules under `Libp2p.*` so Panacea can compose the exact subset
  required by Ethereum consensus networking.

  Status: scaffold only. See `Libp2p.Supervisor` (coming) for runtime wiring.
